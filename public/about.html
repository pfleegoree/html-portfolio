<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Lena Rostova hails from the vibrant city of Austin, Texas, but her literary heart beats in sync with the rhythms of 
  two distinct cultures, thanks to her fluency in both English and Russian. 
  With a keen ability to draw from the richness of these languages and worlds, 
  Lena crafts emotionally charged thrillers that captivate readers from the very first page.</p>
  Her debut, "Napoleon's Bride", is a dark and nerve-wrenching tale set against the iconic backdrops of St. Petersburg and Paris. 
  <p>Lena's passion for travel not only fuels her stories but also transports her readers to both dark corners and dazzling vistas 
  of cities around the world.
